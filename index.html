            <p>Up in space, turning around, looking at the earth’s face. From that rock’s perspective on Mars or that
                gaz opinion
                from Jupiter, nothing cares about your problems. Up there, it’s just not serious, and there’s no such
                thing as an
                issue.
                Down here, the only reality is the one inside our brain. Nothing exists if the brain doesn’t think it.
                Nothing
                exists neither if our senses don’t transmit the message. That means that if we mis sense, our reality
                changes.
                That’s possible because our perception is limited : you can’t see at 360 degrees for example. If we mis
                translate
                the message, our reality changes. If we think it in a way, our reality changes depending on that way.
                Therefore, if
                we can change reality that much, everything’s fake.
                They’re proofs to that. Fall in love with someone and you’ll see that person as divine. Pull yourself
                out of that
                grip and the divine falls from clouds to solid ground, revealing him or herself differently. But the
                person is the
                same, you just changed your mind. Everything works like that : it’s not just that you can make your
                world, it’s that
                you passively do it anyway.</p>

        <p>Once upon a time there was a Chinese farmer whose horse ran away. That evening, all of his neighbors came
            around to
            commiserate. They said, “We are so sorry to hear your horse has run away. This is most unfortunate.” The
            farmer
            said, “Is it good? Is it bad? I don't know.” The next day the horse came back bringing seven wild horses
            with it,
            and in the evening everybody came back and said, “Oh, isn’t that lucky. What a great turn of events. You now
            have
            eight horses!”
            The farmer again said, “Is it good? Is it bad? I don't know.” The following day his son tried to break one
            of the
            horses, and while riding it, he was thrown and broke his leg. The neighbors then said, “Oh dear, that’s too
            bad,”
            and the farmer responded, “Is it good? Is it bad? I don't know.” The next day the conscription officers came
            around
            to conscript people into the army, and they rejected his son because he had a broken leg. Again all the
            neighbors
            came around and said, “Isn’t that great!” Again, he said, “Is it good? Is it bad? I don't know.”
            The whole process of nature is an integrated process of immense complexity, and it’s really impossible to
            tell
            whether anything that happens in it is good or bad — because you never know what will be the consequence of
            the
            misfortune; or, you never know what will be the consequences of good fortune.</p>

        <h4>Conclusion</h4>
        <q>Good and Bad are just one perspective. <strong> Bananas are good for monkeys, but monkeys are not good for
                bananas.</strong> Let's
            not make a
            big deal out of it...</q>
        <p>This story revolves around an old Chinese farmer who encounters a series of
            events that challenge the conventional notions of good and bad. When his horse
            runs away, his neighbors express sympathy, but the farmer remains unperturbed,
            stating that he doesn't know if it's good or bad. Surprisingly, the horse returns
            with additional horses, prompting the neighbors to celebrate his good fortune.
            Yet again, the farmer remains neutral, questioning whether it's truly good.
            The story takes a turn when his son breaks his leg while attempting to tame
            one of the new horses. The neighbors express their sympathy, but the
            farmer maintains his perspective of uncertainty. Finally, when the
            conscription officers arrive, his son is exempted due to his injury,
            leading the neighbors to rejoice once again. And once again, the farmer
            refrains from labeling the situation as purely good. The story's
            underlying message is that the complex nature of life makes it
            impossible to definitively judge events as either good or bad,
            as the consequences of misfortune or fortune
            can unfold unexpectedly.</p>
